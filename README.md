# Handwritten Digits Classification using CNN

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation to classify handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. The code is written in Python and utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the model.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install TensorFlow using pip:

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). It consists of a training set and a test set, with 60,000 and 10,000 images, respectively. Each image is a 28x28 pixel array.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries by running:

3. Execute the Python script to train and test the CNN model on the MNIST dataset:

## Code Explanation
The Python script "mnist_cnn.py" contains the following major steps:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Load the MNIST dataset and split it into training and test sets.
   - Scale the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.

2. CNN Model Definition:
   - Create a sequential CNN model using Keras.
   - The model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and dense layers.
   - ReLU is used as the activation function for convolutional and dense layers, and sigmoid for the output layer.

3. Model Compilation:
   - Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.

4. Model Training:
   - Train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

6. Prediction and Visualization:
   - Predict the labels for test data and visualize some sample predictions.

## Results
The script will display the accuracy achieved by the CNN model on the test data. Additionally, you can visualize the predictions made by the model on sample test images.

## Customization
Feel free to experiment with the CNN architecture, add more layers, adjust hyperparameters, or try different optimization techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Note
- Ensure you have the required permissions to access the MNIST dataset or any other custom dataset you may use for this project.

- Remember that the MNIST dataset is widely used for educational purposes and is a good starting point for learning image classification with CNNs.

- Please use this code responsibly and be mindful of GitHub API usage limits if you use GitHub extensively for version control.

Happy coding!
